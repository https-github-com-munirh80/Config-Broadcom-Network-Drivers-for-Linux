    Title: "Troubleshooting Network Drivers in Linux"
    Introduction: A brief overview of common issues when networking fails after booting Linux on certain hardware, especially Broadcom chipsets.
    Prerequisites: Linux system, basic knowledge of command-line tools.
    Steps:
        Identify Hardware: lspci -k, lshw -class network
        Check for Loaded Modules: lsmod
        Load Missing Modules: modprobe
        Verify Network Interface: ifconfig -a, iwconfig
    Conclusion: General advice for fixing other hardware issues using similar steps.

        #!/bin/bash
        if ! lsmod | grep -q "brcmfmac"; then
            sudo modprobe brcmfmac
            echo "Loaded missing brcmfmac module."
        else
            echo "Module already loaded."
        fi
